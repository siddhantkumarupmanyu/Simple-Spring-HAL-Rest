// i understood difference b/w @Bean and @Component,
// @Component is class level annotation and @Bean is method level
// @Component makes that class an injectable, like registers that class in the di system
// with Bean you have to create a @Configuration Class and under that you can annotate
// methods @Beans for specific Types/Classes
// like in Dagger2/hilt
// we can define a Module, so think of @Module as @Configuration
// and @Provides like @Bean
// also, we can just annotate the class we want to register with di system with @Inject in its constructor
// same with @Component
// like a repository instead of creating a module in this case a @Configuration
// we can just annotate the class with @Component like in there we can just @Inject
// without going through / creating that/any module

// also, there are only these two things, if i understood correctly
// @Service/@Repository...
// they are just @Component made to be distinguishable from other Components as in reading
// they have no other effect...

// @SpringBootApplication
// is nothing more than
// @EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism
// @ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located (see the best practices)
// @Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes
