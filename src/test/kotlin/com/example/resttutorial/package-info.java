/*
integration test,
controllers with fake repos

it,
repos, i guess this will involve test containers
no need, since for this in memory db is automatically configured for this
but should i? like use real monogo rather than inmemory db
and test this repo with test-containers

unit test ModelAssembler


for now skipping, @Configurations idk how to test, also,
i don't think it doing much apart from configuring di

ut
value type/object

and at the end
test e2e
with TestRestTemplate(for now, not gonna use WebTestClient)
