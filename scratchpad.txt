i want to create different source sets different tests,
    especially, integration tests and unit tests.
    they can share a common sourceset it required like in android
    but imo, that should be required, still ont sure, maybe for some fakes or extension functions.
    idk... will see..


just thinking how is kotlin coroutines integrated with spring.
    like scopes and stuff, especially scopes, when does a thing gets in scope and when does it gets out
